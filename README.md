data_compression
================

Video encoding for 8 bit RGB images, 16 bit grayscale depth images and possibly more.

Here you can find information for installing libav 9, which is required to compile this: https://github.com/strands-project/data_compression/wiki/Setup-libav

Here is the notes on how to use the launch files to compress and decompress the incoming openni_launch topics (there is also stuff for evaluating the compression):

And here is instructions for using the libav command line tool to losslessly compress depth images: https://github.com/strands-project/data_compression/wiki/Use-avconv-to-losslessly-compress-depth-video

Directions for compiling the code: https://github.com/strands-project/data_compression/wiki/Compile-the-code

Any help with getting the c++ api up to shape is greatly appreciated!
